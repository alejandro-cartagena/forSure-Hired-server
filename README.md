## API Documentation

This is a REST Api created for our final project in the Ironhack Web Dev bootcamp.
Below you will find the available endpoints of the backend API made with express, mongodb and jwt for authentication. All endpoints that require authentication are protected by the isAuth middleware and need to check the JWT token before realizing the requested action.

### For Correct functioning:

- After forking/cloning the repo need to run "npm install" on terminal
- You must create a .env file in the server root with the following global variables:

  - MONGODB_URI="your-DB-connection-string"
  - TOKEN_SIGN_SECRET="your-secret-phrase-for-jwt-encrypt/decrypt"(could be anything you want, Example: banana ðŸ˜Š)
  - REACT_APP_URL="your frontend app url"
- Enjoy the project! ðŸ¥°
